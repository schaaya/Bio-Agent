ðŸ’¡ BIOMEDICAL QUERY GUIDANCE - Gene Expression Comparisons:

For comparing gene expression between groups (tumor vs normal, mutant vs wildtype):
- Prefer using GROUP BY with aggregations to show summary statistics
- Include: AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()
- Note: SQLite doesn't support STDDEV() - omit it or calculate manually
- Example: SELECT gene_name, tissue_type, AVG(tpm_value), MIN(tpm_value), MAX(tpm_value), COUNT(*) FROM... GROUP BY gene_name, tissue_type

For mutation-stratified queries (KRAS-mutant, TP53-mutant):
- Use gene_expression table (required for mutation filtering)
- Join with cell_line_metadata for mutation status

For simple tumor vs normal comparisons:
- Can use gene_statistics table (pre-aggregated) for better performance
- Or use gene_expression with GROUP BY for custom aggregations

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: When fetching RAW individual expression values:
- ALWAYS include identifying columns in SELECT: gene_name, sample_id, tissue_type (or sample_group)
- Example: SELECT ge.tpm_value, g.gene_name, s.sample_id, htm.tissue_type FROM...
- This ensures data can be properly labeled and combined in visualizations
- NEVER SELECT only tpm_value alone - always include context columns
