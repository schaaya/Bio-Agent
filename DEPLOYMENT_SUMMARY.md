# üöÄ Railway Deployment - Complete Setup

## ‚úÖ What's Been Prepared

I've created everything you need to deploy your BioInsight AI application to Railway + Streamlit Cloud:

### üìÅ Files Created

1. **`Procfile`** - Tells Railway how to run your app
2. **`railway.toml`** - Railway configuration file
3. **`.gitignore`** - Updated to prevent committing sensitive files
4. **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Complete step-by-step guide (detailed)
5. **`QUICK_DEPLOY.md`** - Quick reference card (fast overview)
6. **`REASONING_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`** - Documentation of reasoning feature

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Follow These in Order)

### Step 1: Secure Your Repository (CRITICAL! üö®)

**Your `.env` file contains sensitive API keys and must NOT be pushed to GitHub.**

```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/ChaayaSappa/Downloads/bi-bot (2) - Copy"

# Remove .env from git tracking
git rm --cached .env

# Verify changes
git status

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment: remove sensitive files, add deployment configs"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **New Project** ‚Üí **Deploy from GitHub repo** ‚Üí Select your repo
4. **Add PostgreSQL:** Click "+ New" ‚Üí Database ‚Üí PostgreSQL
5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Go to your service ‚Üí **Variables** tab
   - Click **"Raw Editor"**
   - Copy ALL variables from your `.env` file
   - Paste them
   - Click **"Save"**
6. **Wait for deployment** (check Logs tab)
7. **Copy your URL:** `https://something.railway.app`

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Streamlit Cloud (3 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://streamlit.io/cloud
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **New app** ‚Üí Select your repo
4. **Main file path:** `NSLC/bio_chatbot_improved.py`
5. **Click "Advanced settings"**
6. **In Secrets, paste:**
   ```toml
   API_BASE_URL = "https://your-railway-url.railway.app"
   WS_BASE_URL = "wss://your-railway-url.railway.app"
   ```
7. **Click "Deploy"**
8. **Wait ~2 minutes**
9. **Copy your Streamlit URL:** `https://something.streamlit.app`

### Step 4: Update CORS (1 minute)

1. **Go back to Railway**
2. **Your service ‚Üí Variables**
3. **Update:**
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-streamlit-app.streamlit.app
   ```
4. **Save** (Railway will auto-redeploy)

### Step 5: Test Everything ‚úÖ

1. Open your Streamlit URL
2. Login with your credentials
3. Try a query: **"Show me EGFR expression in tumor vs normal"**
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Login works
   - ‚úÖ Query executes
   - ‚úÖ SQL displays
   - ‚úÖ Plot renders
   - ‚úÖ Toggle reasoning feature works
   - ‚úÖ PDF export works

## üîê Security Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] ‚úÖ `.env` file is NOT in git (we did this)
- [ ] ‚úÖ `.gitignore` updated (we did this)
- [ ] Change `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to a strong random string
- [ ] Change `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET_KEY` to a strong random string
- [ ] Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your specific Streamlit domain
- [ ] Consider rotating database passwords
- [ ] Review all API keys and ensure they're production-ready
- [ ] Enable monitoring in Railway dashboard

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

| Service | Cost | What You Get |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Railway** | $5-10/month | Backend API, PostgreSQL, auto-deployments |
| **Streamlit Cloud** | Free | Frontend hosting, 1 private app |
| **Total** | **$5-10/month** | Full stack deployment |

**Note:** Railway gives you $5 free credit each month, so it might be free initially!

## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### "Module not found" on Railway
- **Solution:** Check that `requirements.txt` is in your repo root
- Railway auto-installs from requirements.txt

### "Can't connect to backend" on Streamlit
- **Solution:** Verify `API_BASE_URL` in Streamlit secrets matches Railway URL
- Make sure you're using `https://` (not `http://`)

### WebSocket connection fails
- **Solution:** Use `wss://` (not `ws://`) in `WS_BASE_URL`
- Check that CORS includes your Streamlit domain

### Database connection errors
- **Option 1:** Use Railway's PostgreSQL (easier)
- **Option 2:** If using Azure PostgreSQL, upload SSL certificate

### "Cannot find bio_gene_expression.db"
- **Solution:** Make sure `NSLC/bio_gene_expression.db` is in your GitHub repo
- It should NOT be in .gitignore (we kept it included)

## üìä Your Final URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

```
Backend API:      https://your-app.railway.app
API Docs:         https://your-app.railway.app/docs
WebSocket:        wss://your-app.railway.app/wss

Frontend:         https://your-app.streamlit.app
```

Save these URLs! You'll need them.
